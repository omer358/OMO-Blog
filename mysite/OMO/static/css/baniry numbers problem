1- convert the base-10 number to binary number(string).
2- create a var for holding the number of consecutive 1.
3- read the binaryString each character at a time.
4- create interal var for the current numbers of frequent.
5- if the number is one increase a variable with one.
6- if the number is zero start over with the interal var













binary =111001010111
var s
for i in binary:
	if i==1:
		l+=1
	else if i==0
		if l>s:
			s =l
			l =0
